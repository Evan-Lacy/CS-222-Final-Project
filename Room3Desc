Pushing your way through the foliage, you topple past a hedge into
what appears to be a greenhouse, filled with many different species of plants.
As you pick yourself up off the ground and stand up, 
you come face to face with a human-sized Venus Fly-Trap, 
its maw gaping at you in what you can assume is the plant facsimile of hungry.
Hurriedly scanning the surrounding area, you notice the exits around you,
making a dive for one before the plant gets you.
