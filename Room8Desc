You enter the owl quarters at Hogwarts, apparently after the Battle of Hogwarts.
As you observe your surroundings, you see the aftermath of a few dead messenger birds.
Appearing that most of animals got away, you see shrines for some of the beloved animals 
while students around you burying the owls.
Looking down in sorrow and melancholy, you notice one near your foot.
