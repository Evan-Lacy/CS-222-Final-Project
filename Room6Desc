Walking into a run draped in darkness, you stumble around.
You can faintly see what is around you, 
thereby convincing you to make a torch, casting the chamber in light.
However, you quickly wish to extinguish the flame as you notice the blood covered dungeon.
You have entered a torture chamber of the Spanish Inquisition during its prime, soaked in blood and bodily fluids and parts.
Relieved by the fact there is no one occupying the room of horror besides you,
you cast your glance around to find the exit as you begin to hear heavy footsteps approaching.
