You walk into the room, covering your eyes 
with your hands as you stumble into a desert.
As your eyes adjust to the environment, 
you begin to notice vultures flying around a cactus.
You walk over to the cactus and look down, 
noticing what looks two giant lizards battling each other.
Finally, one dies and the victor crawls away, 
leaving the carcass lying near you for the flying scavengers.
